			<h1>What is Persist?</h1>

					<h4>Pledge money.</h4><h4> Control habits.</h4><h4> Use Persist.</h4>
					<p>Here's the idea: You pledge money to a select charity of your choice, choose your end date and then commit. Persist until your end date and the money is returned.<br><br><b>Persist works.</b> Negative reinforcement can sound menacing but when you are trying to shake off that 8 year smoking addiction or are simply trying to eat healthier everyday, there needs to be additional reasons to continue.</p>
